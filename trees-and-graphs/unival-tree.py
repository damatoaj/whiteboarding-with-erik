# This problem was asked by Google.
# A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.
# Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
# For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:
#    0
#   / \
#  1   0
#     / \
#    1   0
#   / \
#  1   1
