# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

# F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
# F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

  if num == 0:

  elif num == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fib(num - 1) + fib(num - 2)
