# The goal of this challenge is to implement a console application that displays the most common words used in a portion of a webpage.
# Requirements
# The code should be written in Python.
# The code should return the most common words used and the number of times they are used. The following should be configurable:
# -   The number of words to return (default: 10)
# -   Words to exclude from the search
# Your code (only the source code, no binaries) should be returned as a zip.  The code should build into an executable console application. 
# Page to crawl
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft
# Only words from the section “history” should be accounted for.
# Example of the expected result
#     # of occurrences
# The 205
# Microsoft   113
# in  110
# of  88
# and 88
# a   81
# to  79
# on  59
# Windows 55
# for 50
